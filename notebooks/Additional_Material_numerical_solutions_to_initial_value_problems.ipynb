    "## Initial Value Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In an initial value problem (IVP), we have an ordinary differential equation (ODE) involving some unknown function $\\mathbf{s}(t)$, a function of time $t$ and an initial condition specifying the value of the unknown function at some time $t_0$. (Note: IVP extend to problems beyond just time-dependent functions, but since so many problems in physics are time-depedent, it is useful to talk about them temporarily for an introduction). To make this concrete, an IVP is an ODE:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\dot{\\mathbf{s}}(t) = f(t, \\mathbf{s}(t))\\,,\n",

    "Note that $\\mathbf{s}(t)$ is a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $f(t, \\mathbf{s}(t))$, often referred to as the governing equation, determines the *physics* of the problem. Meanwhile, the initial conditions specifics the *specifics* of the solution we are seeking. You will see what is meant by these two statements with an example shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, an IVP can be solved in *closed-form* using analytic techniques (e.g., if the ODE is separable, we can rearrange and then simply integrate, using the initial conditions to find a *specific solution*). However, oftentimes, when the physics is realistic, it is often easier to turn to a computer to look for a numerical solution. In this notebook, we will explore several approaches to solving IVPs using numerical approximation (also known as numerical integration/quadrature). First, let's set up an IVP for us to solve. \n",
