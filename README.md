# PH3010 Advanced Python

This is the repository for the Advanced Python group project in PH3010.

## Instructions

1. First, read the guide to getting set up, either 
    * [this guide if you are using the lab computer](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/PH3010_advanced_python/blob/main/guides/getting_setup_lab_computers.md) or
    * [this guide if you plan to use your personal computer](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/PH3010_advanced_python/blob/main/guides/getting_setup_personal_computer.md) 
 If you are using your own computer, it would be wise to complete this **before the first session** to get the maximum benefit from the contact time.
2. If you haven't done so already, you may also wish to read this [guide to using the command line](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/PH3010_advanced_python/blob/main/guides/using_the_command_line.md)
3. The main course content is contained in a series of notebooks which can be [found here](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/PH3010_advanced_python/tree/main/notebooks).
4. Instructions for how to download and run the notebooks are given in [this guide](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/PH3010_advanced_python/blob/main/guides/PH3010_getting_started.md)
5. You should start by opening the [overview](./notebooks/0_overview.ipynb) notebook.
