hello :)
hi! :D
hello there, general Kenobi
hello
hi


Has everyone read the assignment 4 and solving Schrodingers equation?? - CR
yes - charlotte
currently doing - james
reading atm - vik
looking at it now - luca


Github won't run the code but can put it in there, people can copy and edit then put it back - CR


Findiff will be useful for the equation as it computes differentials very easily and from arrays, just make sure you understnd it - CR


So each person, after reading will complete a challenge on assignment 4
vik - challenge 5.1
luca - challenge 5.2
charlie - 5.3
james - 5.4
charlotte - 5.5
Any issues??
